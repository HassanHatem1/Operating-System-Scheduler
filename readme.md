## Introduction
The operating system employs a CPU scheduler to establish the sequence in which scheduled processes are executed. This scheduler relies on a designated data structure that maintains an updated record of the processes within the system and their respective statuses. Simultaneously, a memory allocator assumes the responsibility of overseeing computer memory, deciding which processes are to be loaded into the memory and which ones are to be evicted. The intricate coordination between the CPU scheduler and the memory allocator ensures efficient utilization of system resources, optimizing overall system performance.
## Getting Started

1- Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mtheggi/Operating-System-Scheduler.git
  cd Operating-System-Scheduler
```

### Prerequisites

## Algorithms Used in the scheduler
### 1. Highest Priority First (Non-Preemptive)

In the **Highest Priority First (HPF)** scheduling algorithm, processes are scheduled based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is selected first for execution. This algorithm is non-preemptive, meaning once a process starts executing, it cannot be interrupted until it completes or yields the CPU voluntarily.

### 2. Round Robin Scheduling

**Round Robin Scheduling** is a simple and widely used time-sharing algorithm. Each process is assigned a fixed time slot or quantum, and they take turns executing in a circular order. If a process's execution is not completed within its time slot, it is moved to the back of the queue, allowing other processes to get CPU time.

### 3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)

**Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** is a preemptive version of Shortest Job Next (SJN) scheduling. In SRTF, the process with the shortest remaining burst time is scheduled for execution. If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than the currently executing process, the current process is preempted.

## Algorithm Used in Memory Allocation

### Buddy System

The **Buddy System** is a memory allocation algorithm that divides the available memory into fixed-size blocks. Each block is a power of two, and the system maintains a list of "buddy" blocks. When a process requests memory, the system allocates the smallest available buddy block that can accommodate the process's size. If the requested size is not an exact power of two, the system allocates the smallest buddy block that can hold the requested size and splits the larger block into two buddies.
